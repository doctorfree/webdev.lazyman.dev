## Lazyman Supported Configuration Categories

After [installing and initializing Lazyman](https://lazyman.dev/install),
additional Neovim configurations can be installed and initialized using
the `lazyman` command.

All of the supported Lazyman Neovim configurations can be managed using
the `lazyman` command interactive menu interface. After the initial
bootstrap process is complete, the `lazyman` menu is presented by
invoking `lazyman` without arguments.

Currently over 100 popular Neovim configurations are supported in the
following configuration categories:

| Configuration |        |        | Frameworks |
